Description: GWASpops.pheno2geno extends GWAS catalog (from EMBL-EBI) function 
    by providing a framework for users to retrieve and visualize population 
    allele frequency data for any SNPs found within association tables 
    downloaded off of the GWAS catalog. Thus assisting in the process of 
    understanding the connection of disease phenotypes to population genotypes.
    GWAS = Genome Wide Association Study, 
    SNP = Single Nucleotide Polymorphism.
