This folder contains data downloaded from the GWAS catalog. 

All data is meant for verifying efficacy of the GWASpops.pheno2geno pipeline. 

The pipeline was build using the assocations and studies for 'air pollution' in the GWAS catalog, but is not yet able to handle all data from the GWAS catalog. 

'disease' folder will contain the most associations at 50k+, and thus can act as a sort of ultimate test for the pipeline once it is believed to be fully functional. 
^^ I think the 'all_11-6-2022' folder will serve as a form of replacement, as I cannot get disease to load... however. there are .5mil rows in associations... therefore the dataset may just be too big...
